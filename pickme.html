<h2> Short version: I love finding things out.</h2>
<h2> Longer version: I really really love finding things out.</h2>
<h2> Even longer version: You didn't right? Because if you did, that would really hurt me. That used to happen to me as a kid<br> and well </br> it felt nice at first <br> but then the realisation would kick in</br>
  
  <h2> I started with creative writing and then made the leap over to marketing. Along the way realised I really love learning about things. And then teaching people
    about what I've learnt.</h2>
  <h2> Learning about things meant I was a bit of a nerd, so I embraced that side of me. I'm a big fan of interdisciplinary research as this lets me explore all
    the things I'm interested in. I am particularly interested in digital technology (do people still say that?) and what we can do with it.'</h2>
