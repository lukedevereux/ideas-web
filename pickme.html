<h2> Well I feel honoured. You picked me! The first option. I mean I hope you didn't pick me because I'm the first option.</h2>
<h2> You didn't right? Because if you did, that would really hurt me. That used to happen to me as a kid<br> and well </br> it felt nice at first <br> but then the realisation would kick in</br>
  
  <h2> but not to worry. you didnt pick me because I was first, so you don't have anything to worry about. This is a completely different situation. You picked me
  because i am me, and just me. And that's a beautiful fact we can just sit and revel in.</h2>
  <h2> Isnt picking things random? How do we arrive at it? How do we settle with the choices we've made?'</h2>
