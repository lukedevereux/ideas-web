<center><h2> Short version: I love finding things out.</h2></center>
<center><h2> Longer version: I really really love finding things out.</h2></center>
    <h2> Even longer version:</h2>
  
  <center><h2> I started with creative writing and then made the leap over to marketing. Along the way realised I really love learning about things. And then teaching people
    about what I've learnt.</h2></center>
  <center><h2> Learning about things meant I was a bit of a nerd, so I embraced that side of me. I'm a big fan of interdisciplinary research as this lets me explore all
    the things I'm interested in. My PhD was in corporate identity, but I am particularly interested in digital technology (do people still say that?) and what we can do with it.'</h2></center>
   <center> <h2> Please feel free to get in touch if you want to chat about anything. Always open for some nerdy chats.</h2></center>
